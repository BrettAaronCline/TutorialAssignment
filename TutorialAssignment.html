    <h1>How To Create a Personal Web Page using Github by Brett Cline</h1>
        <p1>Start by creating a dedicated directory where you will save your HTML and Image files for your website </p1>
        <img src="./Directory.jpeg">
        <p2>Write your code in a code editor, in the example below I use VS Code. I have included my code for this page as a reference </p2>
        <img src="./Code.JPEG"
        <p3>Once complete, sign up for GitHub</p3>
        <img src="./Sign In Page.png"
        <p4>Once signed in you will be taken to a landing page, from here you will navigate to “Create a new repository” </p4>
        <img src="./Create New Repository.jpeg"
        <p5>Create your new repository - Create a name for you repository and follow with .github.io for example FirstLastName.github.io</p5>
        <img src="./Name Repository.png"
        <p6>Upload all files that are saved in your dedicated directory by clicking the “Upload an existing file” link </p6>
        <img src="./Upload File.png"
        <p7>Drag and drop all files (HTML and any image files you may have used) and select Commit Changes</p7>
        <img src="./Drag Drop Commit.png"
        <p7>Access your repository from the browser using the repository name</p7>
